# eduonix-devops-p2
## Second project for Eduonix Devops E-Degree

In this second project I opted to implement a password generator using Ruby scripting language. The project consists on two ruby files, one that is a module which contains the function to generate the password and the main script which servers as a user interface. To generate the random password just execute `ruby main_program.rb`. A prompt will appear asking the user to input the lenght of the password to be generated. Input this number and that's it!.
